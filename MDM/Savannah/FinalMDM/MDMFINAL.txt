this is my final MDM/journal entry for this project. i will admit i didn't do the best job at documenting my process + journey. i sorta used the github push messages as random little blurbs of my very unorganized mind and work flow.
it is very unprofessional, but very personal. i think i would have had a lot less fun with this project if i tried super hard to make the MDM journal entries as academic and organized as they should be for a portfolio piece. 


regardless, i had fun and im proud of what i did w/ the sheer amount of work i put into this project. i learned a shocking amount (which usually doesn't happen when i take on the artist role (i know how to draw, for the most part)).
i not only got a good few portfolio pieces out of the project (toyol concept art, the game as a whole, and the experience with github, godot, and art asset creation for video games),
but i got nice memories, memes, and work flow that allows me to crank out 120+ art assets in a small time frame ;-D

it's kinda crazy that this class allowed me to do silly stuff like stream a portion of my work process on twitch for a portion of the MDM/dissemination plan. i also got to ramble about zombies, 10/10 

i learned what sprite sheets are and how to do them the quick way (sprite sheet converter . com (tm)) or the correct way (two transparent imgs on one file but the img themselves and the borders are equidistant apart).
i learned how to "sketch" in blender with various sculpting brushes and tools (mirror/symmetry tool my beloved). i also learned that chaos is bound to happen and learning to roll with the punches is the quickest and easiest way to get through conflict and hiccups in the journey.
i didn't overwork myself (too much) by setting boundaries where needed, taking ample rest days when possible (keeping saturdays clear w/ no work), and finding a way to do my work as quickly and efficiently as possible while still being happy with the end result.

i am excited to get this all together and replace my freshman video game project with this one on my resume/portfolio :)

a few of my favorites are:

"a gamer's rite of passage is spamming the fuck out of any open/close toggle
the colors are very different but if you squint and don't look at it, it's fine"

"I realized I'm not about to draw/animate a walk cycle so my offering is this bum ass kid looking 4 different faces.  i kind of have grown attached to this character. in my head she is an absolute nuisance that would put gum in my hair. her name is Mimi (mee-mee)

"my hand hurts
I have created short cuts for my short cuts. There are *so* many instances that I had to just kind of ignore due to the lack of time to polish. (ie, see sweatercloset. I wish I had time to draw out threads, alas...) 
The colors are also *all* over the place. I lost my groove a bit and fucked up the filter I was slapping over all of my 3d renders and can't get it to look the exact same. If I had time, or was being paid, I'd go back and adjust the raw files so everything is the same color before turning it into pixel art. 
i am trying my very best to finish all of the assets required of house 3. the other houses will magically furnish themselves, I just know it. the cut scenes? backgrounds? pah, not to worry. those will also magically appear-- with enough caffeine and metal covers of disney villain songs, just about anything can magically appear.
i also am making Thais's life extremely difficult with these scuffed asset formats so I will need to fix this for her later"
