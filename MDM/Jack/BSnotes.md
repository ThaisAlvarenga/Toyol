Player Character: Undead baby Toyol  

Time Travel Mechanics: Entering the houses (years depicted on the house numbers) will be the mode of time travel. Other hints will indicate time travel: 

  · Your mother ages, you do not 

  · The portraits she is praying to will change 

  · General decor/aesthetics/architecture will change 

  · (insert creative ways of indicating time travel here) 

  · (insert in-depth research of historical events)

One of the reasons you discover you are an undead baby: 

  · As you travel through time, you stay the same age and never grow regardless of the year. The reason is that you can’t age because you are diseased.  

Maybe a possible game inspiration:  

  · Little Misfortune, is creepy at times, cute at times and there are moments where you notice that things are weird
