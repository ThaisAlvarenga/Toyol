OK. I guess this is the start.

In our first formal group meeting, I proudly presented my "stupid" idea to the whole group. The day before this meeting, I was wandering around the local park looking for inspiration. And then, it just hit me. BOOM! A burst of creativity borrowed from Mother Nature—hopefully, I won’t need to return it, lol. Anyway, here’s my idea:
I saw a cool video on Instagram. Using clever video editing techniques, the creator made a visual effect where the person walks at a normal speed, but the background flashes by as if time itself is rushing forward. It gave me the feeling of time travel—everything around the character changes while they remain unaffected, like an immovable rock on the road. This reminded me of an interesting concept I’d heard: that rocks are actually living creatures, just moving too slowly for us to perceive their behavior. I want the protagonist of our game to be the rock!

Next, the game would draw inspiration from Chinese history—something I’ve wanted to incorporate into a project for so long. The massive waves of change in government, society, and ideology during modern Chinese history perfectly fit this time-traveling concept.

And of course, the game had to involve ghosts. Ghosts are timeless, often unchanged by the passage of years. In many fascinating ghost stories, ghosts serve as sources of reliable yet unprovable evidence. Facing a ghost to uncover the truth creates a tension that keeps the story haunting and engaging. That said, I’m tired of jump scares and the grotesque depictions of ghosts we see everywhere. So, I thought: what if the player is the ghost?

And there you have it! The main character of our game: Toyol, a ghost created from the body of an undead infant.

Based on the concept, we had a pretty productive conversation and came up with lots of design strategies for our game. My initial idea was for the main character to stay in the same house but experience it at different points in time. The changes in the decorations and furniture inside the house would represent the passage of time and reflect the societal changes happening outside. The protagonist would travel through time by stepping outside the house, with the background flashing past—just like the Instagram video I mentioned earlier, creating the effect of time travel.

One thing that surprised me was Savannah’s suggestion for a better way for our main character to travel through time. She proposed a neighborhood where houses have the same structure but different appearances. Entering these houses would subtly represent staying in the same house during different time periods. This design adds an extra layer of magic to the game, and I absolutely love it.
