OK. I guess this is the start.

In our first formal group meeting, I proudly presented my "stupid" idea to the whole group. The day before this meeting, I was wandering around the local park looking for inspiration. And then, it just hit me. BOOM! A burst of creativity borrowed from Mother Nature—hopefully, I won’t need to return it, lol. Anyway, here’s my idea:
I saw a cool video on Instagram. Using clever video editing techniques, the creator made a visual effect where the person walks at a normal speed, but the background flashes by as if time itself is rushing forward. It gave me the feeling of time travel—everything around the character changes while they remain unaffected, like an immovable rock on the road. This reminded me of an interesting concept I’d heard: that rocks are actually living creatures, just moving too slowly for us to perceive their behavior. I want the protagonist of our game to be the rock!

Next, the game would draw inspiration from Chinese history—something I’ve wanted to incorporate into a project for so long. The massive waves of change in government, society, and ideology during modern Chinese history perfectly fit this time-traveling concept.

And of course, the game had to involve ghosts. Ghosts are timeless, often unchanged by the passage of years. In many fascinating ghost stories, ghosts serve as sources of reliable yet unprovable evidence. Facing a ghost to uncover the truth creates a tension that keeps the story haunting and engaging. That said, I’m tired of jump scares and the grotesque depictions of ghosts we see everywhere. So, I thought: what if the player is the ghost?

And there you have it! The main character of our game: Toyol, a ghost created from the body of an undead infant.
