Started reworking the game scene manager. I sketched out the logic of the game with pencil and paper. This helped me visualize the different scenes of the game and how they connect with each other. It also help me understand what types of components will be reused throughout the scenes.

I then used Figma to briefly device what components I will need to make and how they could be applied in the scene logically. I have not used Figma that much in my education and career, but I found that making this extra step of wireframing instead of directly going from paper to Godot, help me clarify some things, specifically that the Inventory should be a UI component that is then added to the bigger House UI canvas layer. Due to time constrains, I am unsure of whether or not I'll be using Figma to make all of the logic of the game, but I've found it valuable for the scene management. We shall see.
