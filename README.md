## Overview

Toyol is a point-clicker game were you navigate houses to uncover the mystery of a mythical creature called a Toyol. The user plays a child and goes through the different time periods that their mother has lived through: From the peacful times with her loving family, to surving during a military occupation and finally to finding contentment in a foreign country. Click around to find out the truths of each home and discover your role in the bigger scheme of things. 

### PLAYER GUIDE: How to go through this game

This demo of the game Toyol shows three of the five houses of the game. It consists of two sections. The <b>first section</b> is a complete playthrough of the opening houese. This section starts the player in the (chronologically) third house where they must complete tasks to uncover the narrative and get out of the house. Upon completion, a placeholder cutscene prompts the user to either go back to the main screen or proceed to the next session. 

The <b>second section</b> shows the neighborhood scene containing all the houses that the player can traverse through. The fifth (chronologically, second house player goes through) showcases assets that express the passage of time towards a future after colonization. Picking up the key in the fifth house unlocks the first (chronologically) house. In this first house, the player can take a glimpse at the life of their mother before war and ocupation. If the player goes through the first house, they can then return to the third house (first house player went through) and open the closet. The closet should reveal a complete sweater. Ideally, the sweater would be in different stages at each of the houses, representing their actual place in the chronology of the game. Through this second section, we want to give a low fidelity example of what navigation would look like between houses.
